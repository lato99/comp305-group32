# comp305-group32
//Sunday May 16 2021, We have came up with an efficient algorithm.
//Tuesday May 17 2021, We have initialized the necessary variables, imported necessary file reading classes, read the file and stored the necessary data for the algorithm.


Note: Our first git commit is the LoongyNumber.java class inside the comp305/comp305-project file. ( We did this accidentaly without knowing, but our second and further commits will be directly in the LoongyNumber.java (which is not in the comp305/comp305-project file.).
