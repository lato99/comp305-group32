# comp305-group32
//Sunday May 16 2021, We have came up with an efficient algorithm.
//Monday May 17 2021, We have initialized the necessary variables, imported necessary file reading classes, read the file and stored the necessary data for the algorithm.
//Tuesday May 18 2021, we wrote the code for the algorithm, that has no erros, but it does not give the desired output for the given input file(provided from the google drive)
//Wednesday May 19 2021,  We came up with another algorithm but. Here is the algorithm:
Put every number in a graph(each number of a student is considered as the vertices)
and the edge weights are always 1. There is only edge from vertex v1 to v2 if and only if v1== v2+1 && if v1 and v2 are the numbers from different students.

Note: Our first git commit is the LoongyNumber.java class inside the comp305/comp305-project file. ( We did this accidentaly without knowing, but our second and further commits will be directly in the LoongyNumber.java (which is not in the comp305/comp305-project file.).


TO DOÂ :
Find how to select which student's number if there are numbers that more than one student has. (Two or more students have the same number.)
