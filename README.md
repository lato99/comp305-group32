# comp305-group32
//Sunday May 16 2021, We have came up with an efficient algorithm.
//Monday May 17 2021, We have initialized the necessary variables, imported necessary file reading classes, read the file and stored the necessary data for the algorithm.
//Tuesday May 18 2021, we wrote the code for the algorithm, that has no erros, but it does not give the desired output for the given input file(provided from the google drive)

Note: Our first git commit is the LoongyNumber.java class inside the comp305/comp305-project file. ( We did this accidentaly without knowing, but our second and further commits will be directly in the LoongyNumber.java (which is not in the comp305/comp305-project file.).
